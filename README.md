# New Brazilian Identity Document Dataset

This repository introduces a new version of the BID Dataset (available here: https://github.com/ricardobnjunior/Brazilian-Identity-Document-Dataset)

We include a novel set of synthetic images and their transcripts following the latest physical format for the General Registration document (RG) in Brazil, with a new entity list and labels for every entity in the documents.

nBID is composed of 1356 images synthesized from 113 real documents provided by UNICO.
